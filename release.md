## Release Checklist

 - [ ] (Manager) Check for the presence of a milestone for the release:
    - If there is a milestone, are all the issues for the milestone resolved? (other than this checklist).
 - [ ] (Manager) Inform Support/Marketing of impending release (and give estimated release dates).
 - (SwEng) Prepare the sources for tarball generation:
   - [ ] Check perflab to ensure there has been no unexplained drop in performance for the version being released.
   - [ ] Ensure that there are no outstanding merge requests in the private repository (subscription version only).
   - [ ] Update API files for libraries with new version information.
   - [ ] Change software version and library versions in configure.in (new major release only).
   - [ ] Rebuild configure using autoconf on docs.isc.org.

     - [ ] Check formatting.
   - [ ] Build documentation on docs.isc.org.
   - [ ] Commit changes and make sure the gitlab-ci tests are passing.

   - [ ] If this is the first tag for a release (e.g. beta), create a release branch named `release_v9_X_Y` (this allows development to continue on the release branch whilst release engineering continues).
